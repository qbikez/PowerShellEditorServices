# PowerShell Editor Services Release History

## 0.4.1
### Tuesday, February 9, 2016

- Fixed #147: Running native console apps causes their stdout to be written in the Host

## 0.4.0
### Monday, February 8, 2016

#### Debugging improvements

- A new `Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices.Host.x86.exe` executable has been added to enable 32-bit PowerShell sessions on 64-bit machines (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `LaunchRequest.Args` parameter (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `LaunchRequest.Cwd` parameter to an absolute path (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)

#### Console improvements

- Improved PowerShell console output formatting and performance
  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters
  - Console output is now buffered to reduce the number of OutputEvent messages sent from the host to the editor

- Added choice and input prompt support.  Prompts can be shown either through the console or natively
  in the editor via the `powerShell/showInputPrompt` and `powerShell/showChoicePrompt` requests.

#### New host command line parameters

- `/logLevel:<level>`: Sets the log output level for the host.  Possible values: `Verbose`, `Normal`, `Warning`, or `Error`.
- `/logPath:<path>`: Sets the output path for logs written while the host is running

#### Other improvements

- Initial work has been done to ensure support for PowerShell v3 and v4 APIs by compiling against the PowerShell
  reference assemblies that are published on NuGet. (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- Initial WebSocket channel support (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- Removed Nito.AsyncEx dependency
